# 14 File Uploads
This is a test showcasing file uploads using `c.FormFile` (we only can support single file uploads for now).

Looking at this link (https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/upload-file/)[https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/upload-file/], the multi uses `c.MultipartForm`, which means some more more complicated parsing. Will be done in future PR.
