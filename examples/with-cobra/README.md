# With Cobra Example
This is an example for how to use GenGo with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), the CLI management tool. Here we can run both the web server and the GenGo parser separately to generate the types, while they both have access to the router object.

The two commands that are available are:
* `make start` - This will run the web server and generate the initial typings.
* `make generate` - This will generate the typings for the API.

## Running the example

To run the example, you need to have a working Go installation. You can then run the web server by running:

```bash
make start
```

And generate the typings by running (at any time, not blocked by the web server):

```bash
make generate
```

The `Makefile` contains the specific commands that are run.


## Important files

The important files in this example are:
* `cmd/*` - This is where the different commands are located and configured.
* `routes/router.go` - This is a function to create the router but _doesn't run it_. 
* `openapi.generated.yaml` - This is the OpenAPI file that is generated by GenGo after you run the `make generate` command.
