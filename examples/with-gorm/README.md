# With GORM Example
This is an example for how to use Astra with [GORM](https://gorm.io), the database ORM. Here we can show that the structs utilised to access the database via models, can also be used for Astra to generate the OpenAPI file.

The database is setup as an `sqlite3` database, and the data is stored in `test.db`.

You can see there is no additional code required to generate the OpenAPI file, and the same structs are used for both the database and the OpenAPI file, the only difference between this and the basic example is the database connection information at the start of the `main` function.

## Running the example

To run the example, you need to have a working Go installation. You can then run the web server by running:

```bash
go run .
```


## Important files

The important files in this example are:
* `main.go` - This is the main file that runs the example.
* `openapi.generated.yaml` - This is the OpenAPI file that is generated by Astra.
