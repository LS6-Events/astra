# With CLI Example
This is an example of how to use the Astra API with a CLI. It utilises some basic features of the API, and some basic types for CRUD operations for a blog system. The results and data are faked, but the important thing to note here is that the types are carried through the entire system, and Astra can be used to generate a full CRUD system with a few lines of code.

It will also create a cache for the data in the hidden `.astra` directory, which can be used to monitor the system - `cache.json` is the file that is used to store the cache.

The two commands that are available are:
* `make install` - This will install the CLI tool.
* `make start` - This will run the web server and generate the initial typings.
* `make generate` - This will generate the typings for the API.

## Running the example

To run the example, you need to have a working Go installation, and have the Astra tool installed. You can install the tool by running:

```bash
make install
```

You can then run the web server by running:

```bash
make start
```

You can then generate the typings by running:

```bash
make generate
```

The `Makefile` contains the specific commands that are run.


## Important files

The important files in this example are:
* `main.go` - This is the main file that runs the example with the new CLI configuration.
* `openapi.generated.yaml` - This is the OpenAPI file that is generated by Astra after you run the `make generate` command.
